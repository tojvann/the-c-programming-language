# The C Programming Language

**C is a general-purpose programming language**  with features:

- economy of expression
-  modern flow control and data structures
- a rich set of operators

***C is not a very high level language, nor a "big'' one***, and is not specialized to any particular area of application. But its __absence of restrictions and its generality __make it more convenient and effective for many tasks than supposedly more powerful languages.

In **1983** , the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) established a committee whose goal was to produce "an unambiguous and machine-independent definition of language C" while still retaining its spirit. The result is the ANSI Standard for C.



> C is not a big language, and it is not well served by a big book.

***C "wears well as one's experience with it grows''.***

### A brief history about C language:

Many of the important ideas of C stem from the language BCPL, developed by Martin Richards. The influence of BCPL on C proceeded indirectly through the language B, which was written by Ken Thompson in 1970 for the first UNIX system on the DEC PDP-7. BCPL and B were typeless languages in contrast C provides a variety of data types.

C is relatively **low level** level language.

*** C provides no operations to deal directly with composite objects such as character strings, sets, lists, arrays.    There are no operations that manipulate an entire array or string, although structures may be copied as a unit. The language does not define any storage allocation facility other than static definition and the stack discipline  provided by the local variables of the function; there is no heap or garbage collection. Finally, C itself provides no input/output facilities; there are no READ or WRITE statements, and no built in file access methods. All of these higher level mechanisms must be provided by explicitly called functions. Most C implementations have included a reasonably standard collection of such function. C offers only straightforward, single-thread control flow: tests, loops, grouping and subprograms, but not multiprogramming, parallel operations, synchronization, or coroutines.***
